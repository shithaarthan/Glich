# The Glitchary - Frontend Implementation Complete

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview
Successfully implemented all required features for "The Glitchary" React application as specified in the continuation request. The application now has proper client-side routing, protected routes, connected modals, dynamic profile pages, and functional forms with validation.

### Completed Tasks

#### ✅ TASK 1: Client-Side Routing and Protected Routes
- **Created `ProtectedRoute` component** that checks authentication state using `useAuthStore`
- **Implemented proper router structure** with `react-router-dom`
- **Public routes**: `/auth`, `/login`, `/signup` - accessible without authentication
- **Protected routes**: `/feed`, `/communities`, `/tune-in`, `/activity`, `/profile/:userId` - wrapped in `ProtectedRoute` and rendered inside `MainLayout`
- **Root path redirection**: `/` redirects to `/feed` when authenticated, `/auth` when not

#### ✅ TASK 2: Connected Modals and State
- **Sidebar.tsx**: Added `onClick` handler for "Create Echo" button that calls `openCreateEchoModal()`
- **MainLayout.tsx**: 
  - Added `EditProfileModal` component alongside `CreateEchoModal`
  - Added `Header` component for mobile view
  - Made main content margin dynamic: `ml-0 lg:ml-[280px]`
- **Fixed sidebar positioning issue** that was preventing visibility on large screens

#### ✅ TASK 3: Dynamic Profile Page
- **Profile.tsx**: 
  - Uses `useParams` hook to get `userId` from URL
  - Gets `user` object from `useAuthStore` instead of mock data
  - Shows "Edit Profile" button only when `userId` matches logged-in user's ID
  - Shows "Follow" button for other users' profiles
  - Dynamic content based on auth state

#### ✅ TASK 4: Form Handling with react-hook-form
- **CreateEchoModal.tsx**: 
  - Implemented `react-hook-form` with validation
  - Form submits with `console.log` output
  - Proper error handling and form reset
- **EditProfileModal.tsx**: 
  - Implemented `react-hook-form` for Name, Username, and Bio fields
  - Form validation and submission handling
  - Pre-populated with current user data

#### ✅ BONUS: Enhanced Authentication Pages
- **Login.tsx** and **SignUp.tsx**: Added "Try Demo Mode" option to showcase mock data
- **Auth.tsx**: Already had demo mode functionality
- **Button.tsx**: Added `outline` variant for better UI

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Dependencies Added
- `react-hook-form` - Form state management and validation
- `clsx` - Conditional class names utility
